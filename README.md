# IA (Inteligența Artificială)

This repository contains assignments, implemented as part of the course **Inteligența Artificială** (**Artificial Intelligence**). 

The assignments are focuses on learning basic AI concepts in the programming language `Prolog`. Each assignment has a corresponding `lab` folder with the source code and a markdown explanation document. Assignments are all in *Romanian*.

To run any code, you will need a `Prolog` compiler. There is an online one, but I recommend installing it instead. It's faster and it's portable. Get it [here](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable).

> The markdown files use [tex math formulas, which won't show on github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog). To see formulas, you will either have to convert markdown to html or pdf, with [`MathJax`](https://www.mathjax.org/) enabled, or find the compiled pdf's [on my google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rs0-qy6ivSDuHh5JadrP4Ta4YDhuVRiC).

PR's with grammar corrections, bug fixes, improvement suggestions or translations are very welcome.

Leave a star as a way to say "Thank you". Enjoy!
